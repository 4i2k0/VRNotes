# Interaction
[Discussion Link](https://github.com/orgs/sit-dia/discussions/24)

- Differentiate AR,VR,MR and XR
> - AR overlays digital information or virtual objects onto the real world, where users are still able to see and interact with their physical surroundings while additional digital content is integrated into their environment
> - VR immerses users into a completely simulated environment, shutting out the physical world
> - Mixed Reality (MR) combines elements of both AR and VR. Blending digital content with the real world while maintaining interaction betwween the 2. MR systems are capable of understanding and responding to the user's physical environment in real time.
> - Extended Reality (XR) is an umbrella term that encompasses all immersive technologies. Including AR, VR, MR.

> - RF is how realistic the assets are
> - EPM is how interaction affords realism
