# Interaction
[Discussion Link](https://github.com/orgs/sit-dia/discussions/24)

- Differentiate AR,VR,MR and XR
> - AR overlays digital information or virtual objects onto the real world, where users are still able to see and interact with their physical surroundings while additional digital content is integrated into their environment
> - VR immerses users into a completely simulated environment, shutting out the physical world
> - Mixed Reality (MR) combines elements of both AR and VR. Blending digital content with the real world while maintaining interaction betwween the 2. MR systems are capable of understanding and responding to the user's physical environment in real time.
> - Extended Reality (XR) is an umbrella term that encompasses all immersive technologies. Including AR, VR, MR.

> - EWK is how much system understands the real world
> - RF is how realistic the assets are
> - EPM is how interaction affords realism

- extent world knowledge
- reproduction fidelity
>- Refers to how accurately and realistically the virtual environment reproduces real-world elements. Such as visual, audio and interaction fidelity.
>- Visual fidelity: quality and realism of graphics and visual effects in VR
>- Audio fidelity: accuracy and realism of spatial audio, including the positioning and behavior of sound sources
>- Interaction fidelity: concerns the realism and responsiveness of object interactions within the virtual environment.
  
- Extent of presence metaphor
>- Refers to the degree to which users feel present and engaged within the virtual environment. The feeling of "being there" imersed in the virtual world.

- Coherence
> - Refers to the Consistency and Believability of the virtual environment
> - For a moment I believed that i was actuall 1000ft above ground.
> - Things are described from the user's perspective

- Affordance
> Refers to the perceived possibilities for action or interaction within the virtual environment. It influences how users intrinsically interact with objects and navigate the virtual space
> Improving affordance:
>> - Hand tracking that allows natural manipulation of objects
>> - Having objects with clear grooves for gripping
>> - Haptic feedback when an object correctly fits into place
>> - Highlighting interactive objects with subtle glow effects

- describe the historical evolution of immersive technologies

- explain immersion as system properties
>- Example of factors describing immersion from a systems perspective
>> - Wide FOV
>> - 8K resolution display
>> - 6-DOF inside out tracking

- explain immersion as user experience

- explain the key dimensions of presence, flow, cybersickness
  
- describe how to employ different quantitative and qualitative user research methods to evaluate presence, flow and cybersickness
